# Codebase for Morale Boys FC Football Top 5 Club Draft

MBFC will be a web page that keeps track of table data and points for drafted
teams of Nick/Cole/Jeremy/Colton. This is a solution to what we currently use,
aka, track this data in google sheets.

## Technical plans

Planning on using React.js for the front-end and a basic express server for the
back and keeping track of minimal data in mongo.
